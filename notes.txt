TODO

	- IParseConfig :
		- check root and lcoation path => don't start with / but ends with /
		- servername must not appears twice
		- handle an host belonging to multiple listenServer 
			- need to add hostName to multiple listenServer
			- when removing an host
				- removes it from all its server
			- when removing a listenServer
				- for each host, if it doesn't point to a listenServer anymore, delete it


	- Parsing headers
		- Verifiy : 
			- content-Encoding
			- cookies ?

	- IControl
		- Body parsing handling from IControl
		- parsing URL method
		- checking host configuration/authorizations
		- (dir listing??)
			- stack on the go

	- Mimetype static class
	- errors static class

	- response implemtatntation
		- ERRORS
		- CGIREsponsese
		- STaticRespomnse

Body parsing: function taking ostream* ?

	- if error
		=> close connection
	- if GET/(DELETE?)
		=> parse but ignored (compare with content-length)
			- if chunck, until EOC
	- CGI
		=> POST
			- /tmp/
	- Static upload
		=> check server rules
		=> if text-plain
			- check url for path
		=> if multiform/part
			- special parsing;
				- tmp file that is parsed afterward
